anujnair.com
============

AnujNair.com is my own personal website, created using the Zend Framework.

It has been created primarily for me to try new things (New Frameworks, design patterns, caching techniques etc.) but also acts as my own Portfolio and personal Blog.

The code behind this site can be found in my own personal GitHub repo, located at https://github.com/AnujRNair/anujnair.com
